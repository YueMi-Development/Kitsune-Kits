# Kitsune-Kits

**Kitsune-Kits** is a repository containing Pterodactyl eggs that have been adapted and enhanced to work seamlessly within the **Kitsune Panel** ecosystem. These eggs serve as pre-configured templates for various game servers and applications, making deployment easier, faster, and compatible with Kitsune's custom features.

## Purpose

While Pterodactyl eggs are designed for the standard Pterodactyl panel, Kitsune-Kits modifies them to integrate with Kitsune's unique structure, node naming conventions, and resource management. This ensures:

- Compatibility with Kitsune Panel's node ("tails") and category ("dens") system.
- Smooth deployment and automation within the Kitsune environment.
- Easier customization and updates without breaking existing deployments.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your Kitsune Panel server.
2. Import the eggs into your Kitsune Panel admin interface.
3. Configure server-specific options as needed.
4. Deploy and manage servers directly from the Kitsune Panel dashboard.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! If you have custom eggs or improvements for existing ones, please submit a pull request. Ensure your modifications maintain compatibility with Kitsune Panel.
